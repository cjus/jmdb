# JMdb
A JSON Memory Database with an RESTFul API.

JMdb allows clients to store, retrieve, query, update and delete JSON documents.

This is accomplished using HTTP methods to specify CRUD (Create, Request, Update and Delete) operations on JSON data. Query operations are also supported which aids in requesting only the specific information your application needs.
